# Cursor Repo Rules
- Use TypeScript strict and ensure no implicit any.
- Never commit secrets or API keys; load from env.
- All user-visible strings must be centralized for future i18n.
- Mobile: Explain permission rationale and guard features behind flags.
- Architecture: keep screens/components/services separated; use React Query for data.
- Write/update tests with any feature change; keep >80% changed lines covered.
- Follow infra/prompts/reviewer_checklist.md before marking tasks done.
